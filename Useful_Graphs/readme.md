## chi_square_line.py

This program runs by importing two functions from two external file:
    Least_Squares_Line.py
    Chi_Squared_Line.py
both from the 'Chi_Squared_Fit' directory.
To run use: 
$ python chi_square_line.py

For other fits, simply change the imported functions at the top of the chi_square.py program.
The other two programs can then be modified accordingly to give the desired fit, e.g. a quadratic, etc.

## least_squares.py

This program runs by importing one function from one external file:
    LS_Poly.py
from the 'LS_Polynomials' directory.
To run use:
$ python least_squares.py

Some of the code in the 'LS_Poly.py' program may need to be changed for other non-linear fits and for file names of pdf, etc.
